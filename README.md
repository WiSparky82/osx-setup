# How to Use

## SSH Key Setup
Because certain versions OS X may save your git password in a locally accessible way, when cloning with HTTPS, I much prefer to only clone with SSH. Therefore, the SSH setup script is its own entry point. 

* [Download the raw version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WiSparky82/osx-setup/master/ssh.sh) of `./ssh.sh`
* Execute `./ssh.sh`
* Attach the copy of your RSA key left on your clipboard to your Git repository host account.
